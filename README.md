Hello 👋 in this projects I followed the course of Stephen Grider, who is a great teacher, which is called as Microservices with NodeJS and React. This is created at the early stages of the course. This code you see here written only for learning purposes to taste or have an understanding the idea of microservices. It is not appropriate to use it in production. It is not following the best practices. To learn more just find the real course.
